python 
////// Python language fundamentals:
It's a loosely typed object oriented multithreaded language 
value assignments :
<variable name> = <value>
integer
string 
float
boolean
None 
In python 3 there is no limit for the integer
Collection types in python: 
lists
dictionary
set 
tuples
defaultdict : you can assign a default value for keys that are not defined in the dictionary.
set : 
set.discard() :- doesn't give an error when the value is not present in the set 
Bitwise :
not operator :- # ~1 = 0

Operator presedence: 
PEMDAS : paranthesis, exponent, multiplication, division, addition, suntraction.
global foo:

foo = 1
def func():
    global foo # creating foo global changes the global value of foo too. 
    foo = 2
func() # you would have to call the function 
     
print("True") if True else print("False")
List comprehension:
comprehensions are syntactic constructs that are used to generate lists from other lists by applying function to each element in the list.
Generator comprehension:
it creates a generator object that cannot be indexed it will only be used after using another function.
range returns a list where xrange returns a generator object.
Decorators:
are keywords that can be associated with a fuction to
alter the functionality of a function without having to change the code of the decorated function.
