I know this is backend diaries but hey, let's do this.
component based architecture: component is a unit that gets rendered in the ui. components help in mantainability and re-usability.
Virtual DOM: improves performance.
Unidirectional dataflow: keeps data flowing in a single direction keeping it easy to debug.
JSX syntax: it is similar to xml and html tags, easy to write and bind events in components.
SEO performance: the SEO performance can be improved using server side rendering. 

ReactStrictMode:
identifying components with unsafe life cycles.
warning about legacy string ref API.
warning about deprecated findMODnode usage.
detecting Unexpected side effects.
detecting legacy context API.
