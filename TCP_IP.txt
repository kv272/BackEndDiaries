TCP/IP :
IP(internet protocol):
this is a poor version of internet protocols which is used for sending packets across nodes or systems.
this packets are packed with a header and data. the header contains the important information about the destination for the 
packet to be delivered. 

TCP:
this is built upon the internet protocol to overcome the cons of internet protocol TCP uses handshaking for transmitting packets
the cons TCP has are:
it loses data packets between nodes and doesn't necesarily sends packet in the order they are intended for.
TCP overcomes this problem by using handshaking method which requires an acknowledgement for every packet sent 

TCP requires a connection to be established before sending packets over the network 
this connection is established like this 
            sender                              reciever
1.      SYN (synchonize)     ------------>    
2.                           <------------      SYN ack(synchronize acknowledgement)
3.      ACK (acknowledgement)------------>     


this is how the connection is established.
